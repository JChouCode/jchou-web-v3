          <span>IoTeX: Software Engineer Intern</span>
          <p>I spent my last summer interning at IoTeX, an IoT blockchain startup.
             There, I created and solely managed codelabs.iotex.io, a community hub for
             IoTeX developers. I also implemented the backend GraphQL api for IoPay discovery feed and feature flag manager using
             MongoDB and React. Additionally, I developed decentralized apps on their blockchain with Solidity and React, such as
           IoTeX RPS, to demonstrate the useability of IoTeX antenna-sdk.</p>
